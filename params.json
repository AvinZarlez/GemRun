The goal is to collect as many gems as possible before dying from hitting the rocks. As your score goes up, the game gets faster.\r\n\r\nI made the game to showcase the following aspects of GameMaker:\r\n  * Buttons and menus\r\n  * Keyboard, mouse and touch controls\r\n  * Real time re-scalable game world (try putting it in a snap view!)\r\n  * Basic collision/point collection\r\n  * Infinite world scroller/runner game mechanic\r\n  \r\n  \r\nCreative Commons Assets used:\r\n-----------------------------\r\nIn order to create this, I used some <a title=\"Creative Commons\" href=\"http://us.creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons</a> assets.\r\n\r\nI do not own these assets, and while they are included in the example code for demonstration, they are not included as part of my MIT License open source code.\r\n\r\nHere are the free assets I used:\r\n  * [CollectCoin.wav](http://www.freesound.org/people/bradwesson/sounds/135936/)\r\n  * [male_grunt.aif](http://www.freesound.org/people/snaginneb/sounds/129346/)\r\n  * [Grassy Carpet Texture](http://opengameart.org/content/grassy-carpet-texture)\r\n  * [Danc's Flexible Game Prototyping Tiles](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have questions!\r\n-----------------------------\r\nYou should [ask them](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/)! I would love to hear from you on any questions you have about the code, game maker, or game development in general.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're interested in seeing more templates (or would like to request I make a tutorial on a specific part), [let me know](http://www.tobiahmarks.com/contact/)!\r\n","google":"UA-44364001-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
