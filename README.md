GemRun
======

A "Temple Run" like endless runner Windows 8 GameMaker Studio template.


About the game:
---------------

You move your character left or right by the keyboard or by tapping on the left/right half of the screen. The goal is to collect as many gems as possible before dying from hitting the rocks. As your score goes up, the game gets faster.

I made the game to showcase the following aspects of GameMaker:
  * Buttons and menus
  * Keyboard, mouse and touch controls
  * Real time re-scalable game world (try putting it in a snap view!)
  * Basic collision/point collection
  * Infinite world scroller/runner game mechanic
